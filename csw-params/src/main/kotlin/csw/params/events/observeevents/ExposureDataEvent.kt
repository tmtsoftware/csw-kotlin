/**
 * This event contains faster changing data about the internals of the current exposure. This data is useful for user interfaces  and Sequencers.
 * This event should be published at 1 Hz during an ongoing exposure.
 * This event does not have much information compared to the IR use case and is primarily for tracking  the remaining current exposure time in user interfaces or sequencers.
 * @param sourcePrefix [[csw.prefix.models.Prefix]] the prefix identifier of the source which is generating this event.
 * @param exposureId [[csw.params.core.models.ExposureId]] is an identifier in ESW/DMS for a single exposure.
 *                   The ExposureId follows the structure: 2020A-001-123-WFOS-IMG1-SCI0-0001 with an included ObsId or
 *                   when no ObsId is present, in the standalone format: 20200706-190204-WFOS-IMG1-SCI0-0001 with a UTC time
 *                   when the ExposureId is created.
 * @param readsInRamp The integer total number of reads in the ramp. Value should  be constant during an exposure.
 *                    (Note: for multi-array  detectors, it is assumed that all arrays work with the same  configuration).
 * @param readsComplete Integer number of current completed read from 1 to  readsInRamp. Should be reset to 0 at the start of every ramp
 * @param rampsInExposure  The integer total number of ramps in the current exposure. Value should be constant during an exposure.
 * @param rampsComplete  Integer number of completed ramp from 1 to rampsInExposure. Should be reset to 0 at the start of every exposure.
 * @param exposureTime Length in seconds of the current exposure
 * @param remainingExposureTime Number of seconds remaining in current exposure • Should count down in seconds – no faster than 1 Hz
 * @return [[csw.params.events.ObserveEvent]]
